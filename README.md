1. Explain in your own words the relationship between a `deck` and a `card`.

1. Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?
`String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);`

1. The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2
(lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has point
value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2, ..., 10 are 2, ..., 10, respectively. Specify the
contents of the `ranks` , `suits` , and `pointValues` arrays so that the statement
`Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);`
initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.

1. Does the order of elements of the `ranks` , `suits` , and `pointValues` arrays matter?
